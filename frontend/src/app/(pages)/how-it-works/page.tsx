          Our project is a web-based application that generates personalized playlists for Spotify users based on their mood input and listening history. <br />
          By leveraging the publicly-available Spotify Web API and the Gemini API, the system will analyze a userâ€™s top tracks and top artists to create a <br />
          playlist that accurately matches their selected mood. Users will input a mood, and the app will retrieve their top tracks, and favorite artists to <br />
          filter recommended tracks.
